Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your efforts to improve the quality of our documentation, code, and repository. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure that your contribution is accepted:

### General Guidelines
- Please fork the repository and make your changes on your fork, in a new feature branch.
- Create a pull request to your fork's master branch, and describe your changes in the description.
- Be sure to include any related GitHub issues in your pull request description (e.g. "Fixes #123").
- Before starting work on an issue, check to see if it is already assigned to someone else. If it is, please ask the assignee if they are still working on it. If they are not, you can ask if you can take it over.
- If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, or if it is requested that you make some changes, please do not be discouraged! Feedback on how to improve your implementation is always welcome. Just ensure that all requested changes have been made, and wait for another review.
- We welcome a healthy and respectful discussion about your contribution. Please try to keep the discussion on-topic, and respect the opinions of others.
- Pull requests that fix typos or other small issues are always welcome!
- Please make sure that your code is properly commented.
- Please do not spam, tag, or DM the maintainers to review your pull request. It will be reviewed when it is ready. (We are all human, after all!)

### Code Contribution Guidelines
- Please ensure that your contribution does not break any existing code.
- Please make sure that your pull request is not a duplicate or spam.
- Please follow the existing code style in your contribution. (We use Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting.)
