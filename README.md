### Cryption

**"Cryption"** is a lightweight, higher level wrapper around the `crypto.subtle` API. It provides some convenient function's by wrapping low-level Subtle API for an average regular developer like me to understand & use cryptography in daily life project's. It just works. : )

>Note: This library is **still in development**. It is not ready for production use. *Please use it at your own risk.*

### Development
