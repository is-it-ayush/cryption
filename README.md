### Cryption

**"Cryption"** is a lightweight, higher level wrapper around the `crypto.subtle` API. It provides some convenient function's by wrapping low-level Subtle API for an average regular developer like me to understand & use cryptography in daily life project's. It just works. : )

>Note: **DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION**. This library is **still in development** and is an alpha stage. *If you intend to use it, please do so at your own risk.*. I'm not responsible for bringing your prod down. : )

I built this as it's too hard to scroll the docs for my fellow [grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) developer's. : )

### Development

- `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
- `yarn test` to run the tests.
